## Introduction

Docker is a powerful tool for creating, deploying, and managing containerized applications. This repository provides a practical guide on how to leverage Docker for your CI/CD pipelines, creating Docker images, and pushing them to Docker Hub for easy distribution.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following installed:

- Docker: [Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

## Getting Started

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shaikalthafcgl/docker-cicd.git
cd docker-cicd

Creating a Dockerfile
A Dockerfile is a script that contains instructions to build a Docker image. In this repository, we have provided an example Dockerfile for a basic application. You can customize the Dockerfile according to your application's needs.

Modify the Dockerfile in this repository according to your application's requirements.

Building Docker Images
To build a Docker image from your Dockerfile, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
docker build -t my-docker-image .
Replace my-docker-image with a suitable name for your image.

Pushing to Docker Hub
To push your Docker image to Docker Hub, follow these steps:

Tag your local image with your Docker Hub username/repository:
bash
Copy code
docker tag my-docker-image:latest <your-dockerhub-username>/<repository-name>:<tag>
Log in to Docker Hub:
bash
Copy code
docker login
Push the tagged image:
bash
Copy code
docker push <your-dockerhub-username>/<repository-name>:<tag>
